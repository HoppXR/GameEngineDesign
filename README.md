# GameEngineDesign

We learned about what game engines are, what they do, where the term came from, and different types of engines that were used in the industry. We also learned the different kinds of engines inside of a game engine, such as a 3D engine, sound engine, input engine, network engine, physics engine, AI engine, etc. More indepth, we learned about the architecture behind game engines.

# GameEngineDesign

We learned about what game engines are, what they do, where the term came from, and different types of engines that were used in the industry. We also learned the different kinds of engines inside of a game engine, such as a 3D engine, sound engine, input engine, network engine, physics engine, AI engine, etc. More indepth, we learned about the architecture behind game engines.

## Reflection
Creating the repository with a blank Unreal Engine project and README took no more than 5 minutes to complete. Both repository and project creation tasks were very simple and straightforward from prior experience. However, when it came to creating the simple game prototype along with the diagram, I seemed to struggle with these tasks. After reviewing the progress I made towards these tasks, I found that I tend to spend too much time focusing on the game creation part, creating a whole player controller, and I ended up not having enough time to create a diagram. Some takeaways from this practice included spending less time creating an actual game and keeping things simple, and keeping track of time and allocating time for each task.

When it comes to self-evaluation, I would give myself a 50 since my prototype was partially complete, and there were definitely areas of improvement.
